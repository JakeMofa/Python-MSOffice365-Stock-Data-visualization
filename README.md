 This is a Stock project which i developed, which uses Python algorithm strucutes, MS office 365, Numpy and Pandas. The code Connects and fetches data from Msoffice, using  Msoffice stock options. Furthermore as  your python Terminal fetches and reads that from the Ms office using  Excel, it pulls data from there with a  consistnet time span continously. It then fetches the data and stores it in a Csv file within your Folder of your terminal, after which the raw data is stored in a csv, which is then processed and structured in a second Csv folder which structures it as time, price, price change. The ohlc csv folder, with the structured format then displays a real time data visualization graph of the following stocks and currencies.
